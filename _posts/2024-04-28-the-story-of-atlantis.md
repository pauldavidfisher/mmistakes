## The Story of Atlantis

Crit. Then listen, Socrates, to a tale which, though strange, is certainly
true, having been attested by Solon, who was the wisest of the seven
sages. He was a relative and a dear friend of my great-grandfather,
Dropides, as he himself says in many passages of his poems; and he
told the story to Critias, my grandfather, who remembered and repeated
it to us. There were of old, he said, great and marvellous actions
of the Athenian city, which have passed into oblivion through lapse
of time and the destruction of mankind, and one in particular, greater
than all the rest. This we will now rehearse. It will be a fitting
monument of our gratitude to you, and a hymn of praise true and worthy
of the goddess, on this her day of festival. 

Soc. Very good. And what is this ancient famous action of the Athenians,
which Critias declared, on the authority of Solon, to be not a mere
legend, but an actual fact? 

Crit. I will tell an old-world story which I heard from an aged man;
for Critias, at the time of telling it, was as he said, nearly ninety
years of age, and I was about ten. Now the day was that day of the
Apaturia which is called the Registration of Youth, at which, according
to custom, our parents gave prizes for recitations, and the poems
of several poets were recited by us boys, and many of us sang the
poems of Solon, which at that time had not gone out of fashion. One
of our tribe, either because he thought so or to please Critias, said
that in his judgment Solon was not only the wisest of men, but also
the noblest of poets. The old man, as I very well remember, brightened
up at hearing this and said, smiling: Yes, Amynander, if Solon had
only, like other poets, made poetry the business of his life, and
had completed the tale which he brought with him from Egypt, and had
not been compelled, by reason of the factions and troubles which he
found stirring in his own country when he came home, to attend to
other matters, in my opinion he would have been as famous as Homer
or Hesiod, or any poet. 

And what was the tale about, Critias? said Amynander. 
About the greatest action which the Athenians ever did, and which
ought to have been the most famous, but, through the lapse of time
and the destruction of the actors, it has not come down to us.

Tell us, said the other, the whole story, and how and from whom Solon
heard this veritable tradition. 

He replied:-In the Egyptian Delta, at the head of which the river
Nile divides, there is a certain district which is called the district
of Sais, and the great city of the district is also called Sais, and
is the city from which King Amasis came. The citizens have a deity
for their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and
is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athene;
they are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some
way related to them. To this city came Solon, and was received there
with great honour; he asked the priests who were most skilful in such
matters, about antiquity, and made the discovery that neither he nor
any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of
old. On one occasion, wishing to draw them on to speak of antiquity,
he began to tell about the most ancient things in our part of the
world-about Phoroneus, who is called "the first man," and about Niobe;
and after the Deluge, of the survival of Deucalion and Pyrrha; and
he traced the genealogy of their descendants, and reckoning up the
dates, tried to compute how many years ago the events of which he
was speaking happened. Thereupon one of the priests, who was of a
very great age, said: O Solon, Solon, you Hellenes are never anything
but children, and there is not an old man among you. Solon in return
asked him what he meant. I mean to say, he replied, that in mind you
are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient
tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age. And I will tell
you why. There have been, and will be again, many destructions of
mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought
about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by
innumerable other causes. There is a story, which even you have preserved,
that once upon a time Paethon, the son of Helios, having yoked the
steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them
in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and
was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now this has the form of a
myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the
heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon
the earth, which recurs after long intervals; at such times those
who live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable
to destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the seashore.
And from this calamity the Nile, who is our never-failing saviour,
delivers and preserves us. When, on the other hand, the gods purge
the earth with a deluge of water, the survivors in your country are
herdsmen and shepherds who dwell on the mountains, but those who,
like you, live in cities are carried by the rivers into the sea. Whereas
in this land, neither then nor at any other time, does the water come
down from above on the fields, having always a tendency to come up
from below; for which reason the traditions preserved here are the
most ancient. 

The fact is, that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer
does not prevent, mankind exist, sometimes in greater, sometimes in
lesser numbers. And whatever happened either in your country or in
ours, or in any other region of which we are informed-if there were
any actions noble or great or in any other way remarkable, they have
all been written down by us of old, and are preserved in our temples.
Whereas just when you and other nations are beginning to be provided
with letters and the other requisites of civilized life, after the
usual interval, the stream from heaven, like a pestilence, comes pouring
down, and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters and
education; and so you have to begin all over again like children,
and know nothing of what happened in ancient times, either among us
or among yourselves. As for those genealogies of yours which you just
now recounted to us, Solon, they are no better than the tales of children.
In the first place you remember a single deluge only, but there were
many previous ones; in the next place, you do not know that there
formerly dwelt in your land the fairest and noblest race of men which
ever lived, and that you and your whole city are descended from a
small seed or remnant of them which survived. And this was unknown
to you, because, for many generations, the survivors of that destruction
died, leaving no written word. For there was a time, Solon, before
the great deluge of all, when the city which now is Athens was first
in war and in every way the best governed of all cities, is said to
have performed the noblest deeds and to have had the fairest constitution
of any of which tradition tells, under the face of heaven.

Solon marvelled at his words, and earnestly requested the priests
to inform him exactly and in order about these former citizens. You
are welcome to hear about them, Solon, said the priest, both for your
own sake and for that of your city, and above all, for the sake of
the goddess who is the common patron and parent and educator of both
our cities. She founded your city a thousand years before ours, receiving
from the Earth and Hephaestus the seed of your race, and afterwards
she founded ours, of which the constitution is recorded in our sacred
registers to be eight thousand years old. As touching your citizens
of nine thousand years ago, I will briefly inform you of their laws
and of their most famous action; the exact particulars of the whole
we will hereafter go through at our leisure in the sacred registers
themselves. If you compare these very laws with ours you will find
that many of ours are the counterpart of yours as they were in the
olden time. In the first place, there is the caste of priests, which
is separated from all the others; next, there are the artificers,
who ply their several crafts by themselves and do not intermix; and
also there is the class of shepherds and of hunters, as well as that
of husbandmen; and you will observe, too, that the warriors in Egypt
are distinct from all the other classes, and are commanded by the
law to devote themselves solely to military pursuits; moreover, the
weapons which they carry are shields and spears, a style of equipment
which the goddess taught of Asiatics first to us, as in your part
of the world first to you. Then as to wisdom, do you observe how our
law from the very first made a study of the whole order of things,
extending even to prophecy and medicine which gives health, out of
these divine elements deriving what was needful for human life, and
adding every sort of knowledge which was akin to them. All this order
and arrangement the goddess first imparted to you when establishing
your city; and she chose the spot of earth in which you were born,
because she saw that the happy temperament of the seasons in that
land would produce the wisest of men. Wherefore the goddess, who was
a lover both of war and of wisdom, selected and first of all settled
that spot which was the most likely to produce men likest herself.
And there you dwelt, having such laws as these and still better ones,
and excelled all mankind in all virtue, as became the children and
disciples of the gods. 

Many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your state in our histories.
But one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valour. For
these histories tell of a mighty power which unprovoked made an expedition
against the whole of Europe and Asia, and to which your city put an
end. This power came forth out of the Atlantic Ocean, for in those
days the Atlantic was navigable; and there was an island situated
in front of the straits which are by you called the Pillars of Heracles;
the island was larger than Libya and Asia put together, and was the
way to other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of
the opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean; for this sea
which is within the Straits of Heracles is only a harbour, having
a narrow entrance, but that other is a real sea, and the surrounding
land may be most truly called a boundless continent. Now in this island
of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule
over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent,
and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya
within the columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far
as Tyrrhenia. This vast power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue
at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within
the straits; and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence
of her virtue and strength, among all mankind. She was pre-eminent
in courage and military skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes.
And when the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone,
after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated
and triumphed over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those
who were not yet subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest
of us who dwell within the pillars. But afterwards there occurred
violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune
all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island
of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For
which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable,
because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by
the subsidence of the island. 

I have told you briefly, Socrates, what the aged Critias heard from
Solon and related to us. And when you were speaking yesterday about
your city and citizens, the tale which I have just been repeating
to you came into my mind, and I remarked with astonishment how, by
some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almost every particular
with the narrative of Solon; but I did not like to speak at the moment.
For a long time had elapsed, and I had forgotten too much; I thought
that I must first of all run over the narrative in my own mind, and
then I would speak. And so I readily assented to your request yesterday,
considering that in all such cases the chief difficulty is to find
a tale suitable to our purpose, and that with such a tale we should
be fairly well provided.
